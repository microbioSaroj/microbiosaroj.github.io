<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Greetings! I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Pittsburgh, working under the supervision of Dr. <a href="https://www.pmi.pitt.edu/people/ant-310" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Dr. Laura A. Mike</a>. My research in the Mike Lab(<a href="http://themikelab.com" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">themikelab.com</a>) focuses on the molecular mechanisms and regulation of capsular polysaccharide–associated phenotypes in <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, particularly those linked to bacterial fitness and virulence.</p> <p>Prior to joining the PhD program, I earned an MS in Medical Microbiology (2019) and a BS in Microbiology (2016) from Tribhuvan University, Nepal. I also have experience as a medical microbiologist in clinical diagnostic settings. My research expertise spans molecular microbiology, bacterial genetics, high-throughput phenotypic screening, polysaccharide biochemistry, and protein structure–function analysis. I am particularly skilled in dissecting regulatory networks that control bacterial virulence traits, integrating experimental and computational approaches to better understand pathogen behavior and adaptation.</p> </body></html>
